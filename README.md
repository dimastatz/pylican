# Pylican - A Programming Game for Kids

## Overview
Pylican is an educational game designed to teach children how to code in Python. With Pylican, players learn programming concepts such as loops, functions, and variables while having fun. The game is suitable for beginners, and it's an excellent tool for parents and teachers who want to introduce their kids to coding.

Pylican has different levels of difficulty, and each level introduces new programming concepts and challenges. The game features a comprehensive tutorial that teaches players how to use Python, and it also provides hints and tips to help players solve the challenges. 

Pylican is an open-source project, and anyone can contribute to the game by adding new features, fixing bugs, or translating the game to different languages. We believe that coding is an essential skill for the future, and our mission is to make coding education accessible to everyone.

## Gameplay
A vibrant game board appears on the screen with Pelican, the main character, in the center. A message pops up on the screen that reads "Welcome to Pelican's Python Adventure! Help Pelican navigate the challenges ahead by using your Python programming skills."

### Level 1 
The player must guide Pelican to collect all the fish on the game board while avoiding obstacles such as sharks and jellyfish. The player can use basic Python commands such as "if", "else", and "while" to control Pelican's movements.

### Level 2
Pelican must navigate through a maze to find the exit. The player can use Python commands such as "for" and "range" to control Pelican's movements and determine the path to take.

### Level 3
Pelican must solve a series of coding challenges to access a hidden treasure chest. The challenges involve using Python commands such as "print", "input", and "functions".

### Level 4
Pelican must use Python to control a robotic arm and move objects around to reach the end goal.

### Closing Scene
After successfully completing all the levels, a message pops up that reads "Congratulations! You have completed Pelican's Python Adventure and mastered the basics of Python programming. Keep practicing and learning to become a Python pro!" The screen fades to black with Pelican smiling in the center.
